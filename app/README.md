# Setting up the Application 

## Introduction

This README provides step-by-step instructions for setting up Firebase Authentication with email/password and Firestore for your Android application. These steps will guide you through integrating Firebase into your project and configuring it to use email/password authentication along with Firestore for database operations.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Android Studio installed on your system.
- A Firebase project created in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
- Basic knowledge of Android development and Firebase concepts.

## Steps

### 1. Add Firebase to your Android project

1. Open your Android project in Android Studio.
2. Go to the Firebase Console and select your project.
3. Click on the "Add app" button and choose Android.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to register your app with Firebase.
5. Download the `google-services.json` file and place it in the `app` directory of your Android project.

### 2. Add Firebase Authentication to your project

1. In the Firebase Console, navigate to the "Authentication" section.
2. Enable Email/Password authentication.
3. In your app's `build.gradle` file, add the Firebase Authentication dependency:

   ```gradle
   implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-auth:21.0.1'
   ```

4. Sync your project to download the necessary dependencies.

### 3. Implement Email/Password Authentication

1. In your Android application code, create activities or fragments for user authentication.
2. Use the Firebase Authentication SDK to implement sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out functionality using email and password.
3. Ensure to handle authentication callbacks appropriately.

### 4. Add Firestore to your project

1. In the Firebase Console, navigate to the "Firestore Database" section.
2. Click on "Create database" and choose the desired location.
3. Start in test mode for now, and you can adjust the rules later based on your requirements.

### 5. Integrate Firestore into your app

1. In your app's `build.gradle` file, add the Firestore dependency:

   ```gradle
   implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-firestore:23.0.3'
   ```

2. Sync your project to download the necessary dependencies.
3. Initialize Firestore in your app's `Application` class or in your activity/fragment:

   ```java
   FirebaseApp.initializeApp(context);
   FirebaseFirestore db = FirebaseFirestore.getInstance();
   ```

4. Now you can perform CRUD operations using the `db` instance.

### 6. Make changes to your app to use Firestore

1. Modify your app's data management logic to use Firestore for storing and retrieving data.
2. Implement listeners to handle real-time updates if necessary.
3. Ensure proper error handling for Firestore operations.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully set up Firebase Authentication with email/password and integrated Firestore into your Android application. You can now use Firebase for user authentication and Firestore for database operations in your app.
